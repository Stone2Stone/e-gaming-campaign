          During their 2023 annual voyage, Innovation Island was discovered by
          SCC with the help of its open-source partner, Red Hat. Here SCC and
          Red Hat found a home for three of their products; Red Hat Enterprise
          Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
          After months of construction, this unknown island is now open to the
          public to explore and discover. Come and discover the endless
          possibilities that Innovation Island has to offer.
